It's aims to bring togeter the best of both the digtal and the analog world: Play classic tabletop with a paper character sheet, a pen, dice and - of course - good friends. Create and edit characters digitally without having to perform calculations manually and enjoy playing a game based on a complex and and carefully crafted ruleset without the need to know any of it in detail.

## About this repository

Ember.js in an absolute blast to work with and I highly recommend checking it out. The community is also very welcoming and the developers are quite active on discord.
